Engage-CS is a collection of community supported frameworks designed to make computer science education more engaging.  These frameworks can be used by computer science faculty to create interesting and engaging assignments in a variety of topics in computer science.  This repository currently contains four useful and engaging frameworks:

**[Vacuum Cleaner Environment](VacuumCleaner.md)**

**[Object-Oriented Game Theory Framework](OOGT.md)**

**[Genetic Algorithm Framework](GAFramework.md)**

**[Swarm Intelligence Framework](Swarm.md)**

Feel free to visit the downloads section for publications, user manuals, distributions, and sample homework assignments (without solutions of course).
