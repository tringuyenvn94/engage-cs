== Swarm Intelligence Framework ==

The Swarm Intelligence Framework is a framework for simulating insect foraging behavior.  Using this tool, students can create ants that interact in an environment attempting to move back and forth between a nest and a food source.  If programmed correctly, the ants should be able to determine the shortest path between the nest and food source, and ultimately switch to only using the shortest path.
