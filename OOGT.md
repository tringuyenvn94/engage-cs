## Object-Oriented Game Theory Framework ##

The Object-Oriented Game Theory Framework is an implementation of a simple game playing application framework that provides an engaging atmosphere for teaching various topics in game theory.  Specifically, students can create intelligent agents that compete in a two player competitive game such as Tic-tac-toe or Othello.  The framework comes with a reference implementation that uses Minimax Search and Alpha-Beta Pruning to create an intelligent tic-tac-toe player.
